# FlashForge Printer Preview

This is a simple tool that allows you to see your printer stats in OrcaSlicer as the printer is printing. I made this since OrcaSlicer does not have a built-in feature to show the printer stats for FlashForge printers (Connection refused error in OrcaSlicer 2.1.1)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](releases)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Windows: Run backend.exe | Other OS: Run backend.py
